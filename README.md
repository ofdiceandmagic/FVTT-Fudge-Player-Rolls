Fudge Player Rolls adds a :poop: button to the token tools that allows you to set a target result for the next player's roll.  
When the next player rolls, the result of their roll will be the target you entered.

# Why
Every DM has experienced that moment where one player's roll totally kills the story, or felt that moment of dread when a player is rolling their 3rd death save during a random encounter and thought "wow it would totally blow ogre balls if this character died right now from fighting a little pack of wolves. And then there are the times when a player rolls investigation in the as-yet-unknown BBEG's office, and even though you set the DC at 30, they get inspiration from the bard and roll a 20 on the die. They've found the big secret in session 3 and all your planning needs to be thrown out the window.

### _In short: Don't be a dick. Don't abuse your newfound power. Use this module responsibly._

# How To Use
Press the fudge button (the poop emoji) and enter the target for the roll.  

Now, the next time someone other than the GM rolls, the result will be the target.  

If the target is larger than the maximum possible roll, the result will be the maximum, and likewise if it's lower than the minimum the result will be the minimum possible roll.   
> The module takes into account adding and subtracting dice and advantage/disadvantage. It doesn't take multiplication and division into account.

**_To erase or change the target before the next player rolls, click the fudge button again._**

# Things To Note
1. Fudge Player Rolls doesn't actually roll any dice. Instead, it intercepts the dice rolling process and enters a fake dice roll message into the chat. This means that some modules, like Dice So Nice and MIDI QOL, are not compatible with Fudge Player Rolls.
